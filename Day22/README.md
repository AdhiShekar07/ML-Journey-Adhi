# 🌲 PCA for Forest Health Monitoring

This project demonstrates how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce high-dimensional hyperspectral data for forestry applications like species identification and disease detection.

## 📌 What is PCA?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. It retains the most important information while eliminating redundancy and noise.

## 🌲 Use Case: Forestry and Hyperspectral Imaging

In forestry, hyperspectral images captured by drones or satellites contain hundreds of spectral bands per pixel. These bands hold detailed information about vegetation health, species, water content, and more.

However, processing all these bands is computationally intensive.

### ✅ PCA Benefits in Forestry:
- Reduces spectral bands from hundreds to a few without losing critical information
- Identifies stressed or diseased vegetation based on spectral signatures
- Enables classification of tree species using key principal components
- Supports post-fire recovery assessment or drought impact monitoring

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- (Optional: OpenCV or rasterio for real imagery)

## 📊 Example Dataset

In a real-world project, hyperspectral imagery would be processed. For demonstration purposes, we simulate high-dimensional vegetation features and apply PCA to reduce them for visualization and clustering.
