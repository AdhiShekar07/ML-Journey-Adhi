# 🎯 DailyByte: Monitoring ML Models (Concept Drift) – From Basics to Advanced

Concept drift refers to changes in the statistical properties of the target variable that a model is trying to predict. This can lead to performance degradation if not detected and addressed properly.

---

## 📌 What is Concept Drift?

In machine learning, **concept drift** occurs when the relationship between input data and the target variable changes over time. As a result, a model trained on historical data might no longer be valid.

---

## 🎓 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're a teacher preparing students based on last year’s syllabus. If the syllabus changes and you keep using outdated content, the students' (model’s) performance will drop. That’s how concept drift affects machine learning models.

## 📊 Types of Concept Drift

- **Sudden Drift** – An abrupt change in data distribution.
- **Gradual Drift** – A slow and steady evolution in data patterns.
- **Recurring Drift** – Seasonal or cyclic changes that repeat.
- **Incremental Drift** – Small changes accumulate over time.

## 🛠️ Monitoring Techniques

### Statistical Monitoring

- 📈 **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
- 📊 **Kullback–Leibler Divergence**
- 🧮 **Wasserstein Distance**

### Model-Based Monitoring

- ⚠️ Monitor accuracy, precision, and recall over time.
- 🔁 Trigger re-training when thresholds are crossed.
- 📉 Drift detection using prediction confidence.
