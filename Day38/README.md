# 🏆 Day 38 – Model Registry (MLflow, Weights & Biases) from Basic to Advanced

## 📌 Introduction
A **Model Registry** is a centralized hub to **store, track, version, and manage ML models** across their lifecycle.  
It ensures that every model used in experiments, staging, or production is **organized, auditable, and reproducible**.

Think of it as your **sports trophy cabinet**:
- Each trophy (model) is labeled with **details** — version, metrics, and training context.
- You can **swap** trophies in the display case (production) with new winners (better-performing models).
- Old trophies are **archived**, but never lost — ready for a comeback if needed.

---

## 🏁 Why Use a Model Registry?
- ✅ **Version Control** – Keep track of every model version  
- ✅ **Reproducibility** – Re-run experiments exactly as before  
- ✅ **Deployment Tracking** – Know which model is in production  
- ✅ **Collaboration** – Enable multiple teams to work together without confusion  
- ✅ **Audit Trail** – Maintain compliance and governance

## ⚙️ Key Features
1. **Stage Transitions**
   - None → Staging → Production → Archived  
   - Manage promotions through manual approval or automated CI/CD triggers

2. **Metadata Storage**
   - Store hyperparameters, training datasets, metrics, environment configs

3. **Model Lineage**
   - Track how a model was created, trained, and improved

4. **Integration with MLOps**
   - Deploy models directly from registry to serving platforms

## 🚀 Tools for Model Registry
### **MLflow Model Registry**
- Integrated with MLflow tracking server
- REST APIs & UI for managing models
- Supports stage transitions & versioning

### **Weights & Biases Artifacts**
- Dataset & model versioning
- Collaborative annotations
- Full experiment lineage tracking

## 📜 Example Workflow (MLflow)
```python
import mlflow
from mlflow import MlflowClient

# Register a model
mlflow.register_model(
    "runs:/<run_id>/model",
    "MyModel"
)

# Transition model stage
client = MlflowClient()
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="MyModel",
    version=1,
    stage="Production"
)
```

---

## 🏟 Real-World Analogy
A **sports trophy cabinet**:
- **Trophies** = ML models  
- **Labels on trophies** = model metadata & version info  
- **Current display** = production model  
- **Stored trophies** = archived models ready for reactivation
