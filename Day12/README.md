# 🧠 ML Daily Byte – Day 12: Regularization (L1, L2, ElasticNet)

Regularization is a technique used to reduce **overfitting** by adding a **penalty** to the model’s complexity.

Without regularization, models can become too powerful and start memorizing noise.  
With regularization, we guide the model to stay simple and generalizable.

---

## 🔍 Why Regularization?

- Helps prevent **overfitting**
- Penalizes **large coefficients** (model weights)
- Keeps the model **focused on what's important**

## 🍕 Real-World Analogy: Pizza Delivery Prediction App

You're building an ML model to predict pizza delivery time.  
Some useful features: Distance, Order Size  
Some random ones: Type of pizza box, Streetlight brightness 🌃

🧠 Without regularization: the model might believe “big boxes = longer delivery” 😅  
🧠 With regularization: the model **ignores useless features** or **shrinks their impact**

## 🔢 Types of Regularization

### 📏 L1 Regularization (Lasso)
- Adds **sum of absolute values** of weights to loss
- Formula: `Loss = MSE + λ * |w|`
- ✅ Feature selection (some weights become exactly **zero**)

### 📐 L2 Regularization (Ridge)
- Adds **sum of squared values** of weights
- Formula: `Loss = MSE + λ * w²`
- ✅ Shrinks all weights (but none become zero)

### 🔄 ElasticNet = L1 + L2
- Formula: `Loss = MSE + λ1 * |w| + λ2 * w²`
- ✅ Balanced feature selection and weight shrinkage

## 👨‍💻 Python Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Sample dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=5, noise=15, random_state=42)

# Ridge Regression
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge.fit(X, y)

# Lasso Regression
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso.fit(X, y)

# ElasticNet Regression
elastic = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
elastic.fit(X, y)

print("Ridge Coefficients:", ridge.coef_)
print("Lasso Coefficients:", lasso.coef_)
print("ElasticNet Coefficients:", elastic.coef_)
```

3️⃣ **Contour Constraint Plot**  
⚙️ Shows how L1 zeroes out features and L2 just shrinks them

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Use **L1** when you want feature selection  
- Use **L2** when all features matter, but you want simpler weights  
- Use **ElasticNet** to balance both approaches  
- Tune **alpha** and **l1_ratio** to control regularization strength
