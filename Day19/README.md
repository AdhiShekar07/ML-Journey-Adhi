# ML Daily Byte – Day 19: SHAP Explainability 🛰️

## 📘 Concept

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) helps explain the predictions of a machine learning model by showing how each feature contributes to the final output.

It works by assigning **contribution scores** to features, based on game theory (Shapley values).

## 🍕 Analogy – Pizza Taste Score

Imagine rating a pizza. SHAP tells you:
- 🍅 Sauce added +2 to the score
- 🧀 Cheese added +3
- 🍍 Pineapple subtracted -1

Each “ingredient” (feature) has a direct impact on the result.

## 🛰️ Real-World Use Case: Satellite Launch Success Prediction

We train a model on simulated satellite mission data to predict whether a launch will succeed.

### Features:
- Payload Weight  
- Wind Speed  
- Fuel Tank Temperature  
- Launch Window  
- Signal Calibration  
- Time Since Last Launch

🎯 SHAP explains:
- Why a mission is predicted to fail
- Which parameters (like wind or weight) increased risk

## 💻 Code File

- `shap_satellite_launch_prediction.py`:  
  Includes dataset simulation, model training, and SHAP explanation with bar chart visualization.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- SHAP provides **local explanations** (for one mission) and **global importance** (across all missions).
- Crucial for **trustworthy AI**, especially in space, healthcare, and finance.
