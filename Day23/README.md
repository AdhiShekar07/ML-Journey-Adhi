# üß¨ Microscopy Data Augmentation - ML Daily Byte Day 23 (Biotech Use Case)

This project demonstrates how to apply data augmentation techniques on microscopy images to expand small datasets for cell classification, histopathology, or biotechnology research using Keras.

## üìå What is Data Augmentation?

Data augmentation is a strategy to synthetically expand the size and variability of training datasets by applying controlled transformations like rotations, flips, zooms, brightness shifts, etc.

This is particularly useful in biotech fields where gathering labeled medical/microscopy data is:
- Expensive
- Time-consuming
- Limited due to privacy/ethical constraints

## üß™ Use Case: Biotechnology & Microscopy

In biotechnology, models are trained on microscopy images to:
- Classify different **cell types**
- Detect **cancerous tissues**
- Track **drug effects on cells**
- Identify **pathogens** in stained slides

However, obtaining thousands of such images is not always possible.

### ‚úÖ Data Augmentation Helps:
- Simulate cell appearance from various microscope orientations
- Mimic staining differences (color + brightness)
- Add realistic noise and spatial distortions

## üß∞ Techniques Used in This Script

- Rotation (0‚Äì90¬∞)
- Horizontal & vertical flipping
- Brightness variation
- Width/height shifting
- Zoom and shear transforms

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

1. Place a sample microscopy image in the same folder as the script (e.g., `cell_sample.jpg`)
2. Run the script:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
python microscopy_data_augmentation.py
