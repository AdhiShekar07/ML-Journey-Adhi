# 🧠 Daily Byte 24 – CNN Basics (Convolution & Pooling)

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the **basic building blocks of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — specifically **convolution layers** and **pooling layers** — and how they are used for image classification.  

To demonstrate, we apply CNNs in the **aquaculture field**, where underwater images of fish are analyzed to classify their health status as **healthy**, **sick**, or **dead**.

## 🐟 Real-Life Use Case: Aquaculture

Fish farmers often face challenges in monitoring the health of aquatic life. Using underwater cameras and CNNs, we can build an automated system that:
- Detects and classifies fish species
- Identifies health conditions from image data
- Helps with early disease detection and stock management

## 📁 Files

- `cnn_fish_health_classifier.py`: Main Python script that defines and trains the CNN model.
- `fish_dataset/`: Sample folder containing subfolders of fish images categorized by health status.
- `README.md`: This documentation.
