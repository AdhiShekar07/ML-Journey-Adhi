# ML Daily Byte – Day 18: Feature Importance ✈️🧠

## 📘 Concept

Feature Importance helps identify which input variables have the most influence on a machine learning model’s predictions.

Think of it as asking: "Which features really matter when making a decision?"

## 🍰 Simple Analogy

Imagine baking a cake:

- 🍫 Chocolate – Most important for taste  
- 🧁 Flour – Needed for structure  
- 🧂 Salt – Less noticeable  

➡️ Feature importance tells us which ingredients matter most to the final result.

## 🚨 Real-World Use Case: Aircraft Crash Risk

You're helping aviation safety agencies predict crash risks using:

- Engine temperature  
- Sensor errors  
- Pilot hours without rest  
- Fuel imbalance  
- Time since maintenance  
- Weather severity

Using a Random Forest model, we calculate **feature importance** to rank these factors.

🔍 Result: Sensor errors, engine temperature, and pilot fatigue were top predictors of risk.
