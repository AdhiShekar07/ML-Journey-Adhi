# 🚀 AI30DayChallenge – Day 34: Model Deployment (Flask, FastAPI, Streamlit)

Welcome to Day 34 of my #AI30DayChallenge!  
Today’s focus is on **Model Deployment**, where we explore three essential tools used to take machine learning models live:

- 🧪 Flask – A lightweight web framework for building APIs and web apps.
- ⚡ FastAPI – A modern, high-performance alternative to Flask with async support.
- 📊 Streamlit – A rapid prototyping tool for building interactive ML dashboards without frontend code.

## 🧠 What is Model Deployment?

Model deployment is the process of **making a trained machine learning model available to end users** via an app, website, or API.

**Simple Analogy:**  
> “Your ML model is a masterchef 👨‍🍳. Deployment is opening a restaurant so others can taste the food!”

## 🧪 Example Projects

### 1️⃣ Flask – Hello World API

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask Model Deployer!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
