# 🚀 Day 35: Model Serving (ONNX, TorchServe) – From Basics to Advanced

## 📌 What is Model Serving?

Model Serving is the process of **making a trained machine learning model available to provide predictions** (inference) to end-users or applications — usually via APIs. It’s the bridge between model training and real-world usage.

## ✈️ Real-World Analogy: Airport Check-In vs In-Flight Service

Imagine:

- 🛠️ **Model Training** = Building an airplane (you assemble, test, and prepare it to fly)
- 🏁 **Model Deployment** = Parking it at the gate, ready for passengers
- 🛫 **Model Serving** = Actual **in-flight service**:
  - 🧍Passengers = Incoming data
  - ✈️ Airplane = Trained model
  - 🎯 Destination = Predictions
  - 👩‍✈️ Crew = Tools like **ONNX** and **TorchServe** that ensure smooth and fast service

## 🔧 Serving Tools Overview

### 1. **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)**
- Universal format to export models from PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.
- Enables **cross-platform** and **hardware-optimized inference**.
- Compatible with many runtimes like ONNX Runtime, OpenVINO, TensorRT.

### 2. **TorchServe**
- A powerful, production-ready tool to **serve PyTorch models**.
- Supports:
  - REST APIs for inference
  - Batch requests
  - Model versioning
  - Logging and metrics

---

## 💡 Why is Model Serving Important?

- Enables **real-time inference** in web/mobile apps.
- Supports **scalability** with load balancing and concurrency.
- Integrates models into business pipelines, powering smart features.

## 🧠 Basic to Advanced Roadmap

| Level       | Concept                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Beginner    | Exporting PyTorch models to ONNX      |
| Intermediate| Serving models with TorchServe        |
| Advanced    | Deploying ONNX models with ONNX Runtime & Docker |

---

## 🔁 Common Workflow

1. Train your model in PyTorch or TensorFlow
2. Export to ONNX (if needed)
3. Use ONNX Runtime or TorchServe for serving
4. Deploy via Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
# Export a PyTorch model to ONNX
import torch
import torchvision.models as models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "resnet18.onnx")
```

---

## 📦 TorchServe Basic Command

```bash
torch-model-archiver \
  --model-name resnet18 \
  --version 1.0 \
  --serialized-file resnet18.pt \
  --handler image_classifier \
  --export-path model_store
```

```bash
torchserve --start --model-store model_store --models resnet18=resnet18.mar
```
